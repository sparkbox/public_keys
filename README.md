#Sparkbox Public Keys

* Public key repository
* Process to push individual public keys to servers
* Process to build and deploy authorized_keys file from public key repository to each server
* Server catalog (IP addresses, credentials, etc)
* Shared non-root user on each server
* Individual user accounts

##Guidelines
Adding or removing a user's public keyfile should be done with pull requests in feature branches.
